    <h2>Project Goal</h2>
    The goal of this project is to create a model that can forecast the water visibility with a prediction interval below &plusmn;2 m. The forecasting model is intended to be a tool that
    can be used alongside other weather forecasts to check the suitability of the conditions for diving, spearfishing and snorkelling. Any suggestsions or help is welcome and much
    appreciated.

    <b>Major Update: 30/11/20</b> <br>
    A new deep learning model was built within the keras framework and is currently being tested.
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Minor Updates: 25/11/20</b> <br>
    A geospatial plot of visibility was created using my own data alongside data used under <a href = "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode"

    <b>Minor Updates: 13/11/20</b> <br>
    A new model based off of the original was made for specific locations to reduce the prediction interval and is currently being tested.
