    <h1>Project Goals</h1>
    The goal of this project is to create a model that can forecast the water visibility with a prediction interval of &plusmn;2 m. The forecasting model is intended to be a tool that
    can be used alongside other weather forecasts to check the suitability of the conditions for diving, spearfishing and snorkelling. Any suggestsion or help is welcome and much
    appreciated.

    <b>Minor Updates: 13/11/20</b> <br>
    A new model based off of the original was made for specific locations to reduce the prediction interval and is currently being tested.
